FreeBSD does not, and can not warrant that the certification authorities
whose certificates are included in this package have in any way been
audited for trustworthiness or RFC 3647 compliance.

Assessment and verification of trust is the complete responsibility of
the system administrator.

This package installs symlinks to support root certificate discovery
for software that either uses other cryptographic libraries than
OpenSSL, or use OpenSSL but do not follow recommended practice.

If you prefer to do this manually, replace the following symlinks with
either an empty file or your site-local certificate bundle.

  * /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  * /usr/local/etc/ssl/cert.pem
  * /usr/local/openssl/cert.pem

Wazuh dashboard components were installed

1) Wazuh dashboard is based on opensearch-dashboards and wazuh-kibana-app
   projects. This guide help to adapt wazuh configuration for it works on
   FreeBSD using apps are part of ports tree.

2) Copy /usr/local/etc/wazuh-dashboard/opensearch_dashboards.yml to /usr/local/etc/opensearch-dashboards/
   directory

3) You can use my own version of wazuh certificates generator for generate root,
   admin, indexer, server and dashboard certificates used by wazuh components.
  
   https://people.freebsd.org/~acm/ports/wazuh/wazuh-gen-certs.tar.gz

4) Edit opensearch_dashboard.yml file and changes options accord to your
   setup. For example host, ssl, etc. Sample files can give you a good
   guide about that.

5) Add OpenSearch Dashboard to /etc/rc.conf

   # sysrc opensearch_dashboards_enable="YES"

6) Start OpenSearch Dashboard service
   
   # service opensearch-dashboards start

7) Login at OpenSearch Dashboard from any supported browser at:

   https://10.0.0.1:5601

   Listen port can be changed from opensearch_dashboard.yml file

8) You can look more useful information at the following link:

   https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-dashboard/step-by-step.html

   Take on mind wazuh arquitecture on FreeBSD is configurated not similar like
   you can read at wazuh guide.

9) Enjoy it
